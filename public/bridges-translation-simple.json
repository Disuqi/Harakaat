  "8:65": {
    "t": "O Prophet, urge the believers on to combat. If there are twenty patient ones among you, they can overcome two hundred. And if there are a hundred of you, they can overcome a thousand of those who have denied, because they are a people who do not comprehend."

  },
  "9:6": {
    "t": "And if anyone of the polytheists asks you for protection, then grant him protection so that he may hear the Speech of Allah, then escort him to where he can be safe. That is because they are people who have no knowledge."

    "t": "How can there be a covenant with the polytheists on the part of Allah and His Messenger, except for those whom you have covenanted at the Inviolable Mosque? As long as they are upright with you, be upright with them; indeed, Allah loves the people who are mindful (of Him)."

  "9:13": {
    "t": "Will you not combat a people who have reneged on their oaths and have advanced forward to evict the Messenger, and it was they who initiated (hostilities) against you? Do you fear them? It is Allah who is worthier of being feared, if you are believers."

  },
  "9:31": {
    "t": "They have taken their rabbis and their monks as lords apart from Allah, as well as the Messiah, son of Mary, although they were commanded to worship none but one God; there is no god but He. Highly Exalted is He, high above what they associate (with Him)."

  "9:35": {

  "9:36": {
    "t": "Indeed, the number of months according to Allah is twelve months—in the record of Allah (since) the day He created the heavens and the earth, of which four are inviolable.

  },
  "9:37": {
    "t": "Indeed, postponing the inviolable months is but another act of denial by which those who have denied are led astray. They allow it one year and forbid it another year in order to conform to the number made inviolable by Allah, thus permitting what Allah has forbidden. The evil of their deeds was adorned to them. And Allah does not guide the denying people."
  },
  "9:38": {
    "t": "O you who have attained faith, what is the matter with you that when it is said to you, “Mobilize in the way of Allah,” you cling heavily to the earth? Are you content with the Earlier Life rather than the Hereafter? For the enjoyment of the Earlier Life compared to the Hereafter is but little."

  },
  "18:50": {
    "t": "And recall when We said to the angels, “Prostrate to Adam.” So they prostrated—but not Iblis . He was one of the unseen beings, so he defied the command of his Lord.

  "18:57": {
    "t": "And who is more unjust than the one who was reminded of his Lord’s signs then disregarded them and forgot what his hands had put forth?

  "18:77": {
    "t": "So they both set out until, when they reached the people of a town, they asked them for food, but they refused to offer them hospitality. There they found a wall tending to collapse, so he repaired it. He said, “If you wanted, you could have charged a reward for it.”"
  },
  "18:78": {
    "t": "He said, “This is the parting between you and me. I will tell you the interpretation of what you were unable to endure patiently."

  "18:79": {
    "t": "As for the ark, it belonged to some destitute people working at sea, so I wanted to make it defective, for there was a king coming after them, seizing every ark by force."

    "t": "And as for the boy, his parents were believers and we feared he would overwhelm them with transgression and denial."

  },
  "18:82": {
    "t": "And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphaned boys in the city, and beneath it was a treasure that belonged to them, and their father was a righteous man, so your Lord desired that they attain their full strength and (then) extract their treasure—a mercy from your Lord. And I never did it of my own accord. This is the interpretation of what you were unable to endure patiently.”"

  "20:64": {
    "t": "So decide your plot, then come, lined up (in ranks); and the one who gains the upper hand is surely bound to succeed today.”"
  },
  "20:65": {
    "t": "They said, “O Moses, either you cast or we will be the first to cast.”"
  },
  "20:66": {
    "t": "He said, “Rather, you cast.” And suddenly, their ropes and staffs were made to appear to him, because of their sorcery, to be slithering."
  },
  "20:67": { "t": "So Moses felt apprehensive within himself." },
  "20:68": { "t": "We said, “Be not afraid; yousg are the highest." },
  "20:69": {
    "t": "And cast what is in your right hand—it will swallow what they have crafted; what they have crafted is only a sorcerer’s trickery, for the sorcerer will not succeed wherever he may go.”"
  },
  "20:70": {
    "t": "So the sorcerers fell down prostrate. They said, “We have attained faith in the Lord of Aaron and Moses.”"
  },
  "20:71": {
    "t": "He said, “Have you attained faith in him before I have given you permission? He must be your chief who has taught you sorcery. So I will most surely cut off your hands and your feet on alternate sides, and I will most surely crucify you on the trunks of the palm-trees. Then you will most surely know which of us is more severe in punishment and more lasting.”"
  },
  "20:72": {
    "t": "They said, “We will not prefer you over what has come to us of evident proofs nor (over) the One Who originated us, so decree whatever you decree; you can only decree for this Earlier Life."
  },
  "20:73": {
    "t": "We have indeed attained faith in our Lord so that He may forgive us our offenses and what you have compelled us to practice of sorcery, for Allah is better and more lasting.”"
  },
  "20:74": {
    "t": "Indeed, whoever comes to his Lord as a criminal, then surely for him is Hell, where he neither dies nor lives."
  },
  "20:75": {
    "t": "But whoever comes to Him as a believer, having done righteous deeds, then for those are the highest degrees (of rank):"
  },
  "20:76": {
    "t": "Gardens of Perpetuity beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein, for that is the repayment of the one who purifies himself."
  },
  "20:77": {
    "t": "And very truly, We revealed to Moses: “Journey by night with My servants and strike for them a dry road across the sea. You will not be afraid of being overtaken nor apprehensive.”"
  },
  "20:78": {
    "t": "So Pharaoh pursued them with his troops, but there overwhelmed them of the waters that which overwhelmed them."
  },
  "20:79": {
    "t": "Thus Pharaoh led his people astray and never did he guide (them)."
  },
  "20:80": {
    "t": "O Children of Israel, We have surely saved you from your enemy, and have made an appointment with you by the right side of Mount Tûr, and sent down to you manna and quails."
  },
  "20:81": {
    "t": "Eat of the good things We have provided for you, but do not exceed the limits in it lest you deserve My wrath upon you, for the one upon whom My wrath is deserved has surely fallen."
  },
  "20:82": {
    "t": "And very truly I am Forgiving towards the one who repented and attained faith and acted righteously and then remained guided."
  },
  "20:83": { "t": "“And what made you rush ahead of your people, O Moses?”" },
  "20:84": {
    "t": "He said, “They are following in my footsteps. And I hurried on to You, my Lord, that You may be well pleased.”"
  },
  "20:85": {
    "t": "He said, “Yet, We have surely tested your people in your absence, and the Samiri led them astray.”"
  },
  "20:86": {
    "t": "So Moses returned to his people, wrathful (and) sorrowful. He said, “O my people, did your Lord not promise you a good promise? Was the (time of the) covenant too long for you? Or did you want wrath from your Lord to descend upon you, so you broke your promise to me?”"
  },
  "20:87": {
    "t": "They said, “We did not break our promise to you by our choice, but we were made to carry burdens of the people’s ornaments, so we cast them and so did the Samiri cast.”"
  },
  "20:88": {
    "t": "So he brought out for them a calf—a mere body with a lowing sound. And they said, “This is your god and the god of Moses, but he has forgotten.”"

  "20:91": {
    "t": "They said, “We will not give up consecrating it until Moses returns to us.”"
  },
  "20:92": {
    "t": "He said, “O Aaron, what prevented you, when you saw them going astray,"
  },
  "20:93": { "t": "from following me? Have you disobeyed my command?”" },
  "20:94": {
    "t": "He said, “O son of my mother, do not seize me by my beard nor by my head; I feared you would say, ‘You have caused division among the Children of Israel and have not regarded my word.'”"
  },
  "20:95": { "t": "He said, “What do you have to say, O Samiri?”" },
  "20:96": {
    "t": "He said, “I perceived what they did not perceive, so I grasped a handful from the messenger’s traces and I flung it away, and thus my soul prompted me.”"
  },
  "20:97": {
    "t": "He said, “Be gone! For indeed your lot in this life is to say, ‘No touching’, and indeed you have an appointment that you will not be allowed to break. And look at your god that you kept consecrating—we will certainly burn it up then blow it away completely into the waters.”"
  },
  "20:98": {
    "t": "Surely your god is none but Allah, the One besides Whom there is no other god; He has embraced everything in knowledge."

  "20:104": {
    "t": "We know better what they say, when the most exemplary of them in conduct says, “You have stayed for no more than a day.”"

  "20:107": { "t": "You will see in them neither crookedness nor deviation.”" },
  "20:108": {
    "t": "On that day, they follow the caller without any crookedness, and voices were (hushed) in reverence to the All-Merciful, so that you hear nothing but a murmur."

  "20:109": {
    "t": "On that day, intercession does not avail except for the one permitted by the All-Merciful, and He was pleased for him to speak."

    "t": "But whoever does righteous deeds while being a believer, then he neither fears injustice nor curtailment."
  },
  "20:113": {
    "t": "And thus We have sent it down as an Arabic Recital, and We have diversified the warnings in it, that perhaps they would become mindful (of God) or it would bring about in them a remembrance."
  },
  "20:114": {
    "t": "Most high above all is Allah, the True King. Do not be hasty with the Recital before its revelation to you is concluded, and say, “My Lord, increase me in knowledge.”"
  },
  "20:115": {
    "t": "And most surely We covenanted with Adam before, but he forgot, and We found in him no resolve."
  },
  "20:116": {
    "t": "And recall when We said to the angels, “Prostrate yourselves to Adam.” So they prostrated themselves— but not Iblis ; he refused."
  },
  "20:117": {
    "t": "So We said, “O Adam, indeed this is an enemy to you and to your spouse. So do not let him get you out of the Garden, for then you will suffer."

  "20:118": { "t": "In it, indeed, you will never go hungry nor be naked." },
  "20:119": { "t": "Nor will you be thirsty in it nor will you swelter.”" },
  "20:120": {
    "t": "But Satan whispered to him. He said, “O Adam, shall I show you the Tree of Immortality and a kingdom that never decays?”"
  },
  "20:121": {
    "t": "So they ate from it, whereupon their private parts became exposed to them, and they started covering themselves with the leaves of the Garden. Thus Adam disobeyed his Lord and was deluded."
  },
  "20:122": {
    "t": "Then his Lord recalled him and granted him repentance and accepted it from him and guided (him)."
  },
  "20:123": {
    "t": "He said, “Descend from it, all together, some of you as enemies of some others. But whenever guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows My guidance will neither go astray nor suffer."

  "20:124": {
    "t": "But whoever has disregarded My Reminder—for him is a miserable life, and We will herd him on the Day of Resurrection blind.”"
  },
  "20:125": {
    "t": "He said, “My Lord, why did You herd me blind though I used to see?”"
  },
  "20:126": {
    "t": "He said, “Just as Our signs came to you and you forgot them, today you will be forgotten.”"
  },
  "20:127": {
    "t": "And thus We repay the one who was an extremist and did not believe in the signs of his Lord. And surely the punishment of the Hereafter is more severe and more lasting."
  },
  "20:128": {
    "t": "Did it give them no guidance (to learn) how many generations before them We annihilated, amidst whose residences they walk? Indeed, in that are signs for the ones endowed with intelligence."
  },
  "20:129": {
    "t": "And were it not for a word that had preceded from your Lord, the inevitable would have happened, but (there is) a stated term."
  },
  "20:130": {
    "t": "So bear patiently what they say and exalt your Lord with praise before the rising of the sun and before its setting, and during the hours of the night exalt Him, and at the (two) ends of the day, that you may be well pleased."

  "20:131": {
    "t": "And never extend your eyes towards what We have given some classes of them to enjoy—the splendor of the Earlier Life—that We may test them thereby, for your Lord’s provision is better and more lasting."
  },
  "20:132": {
    "t": "And command your people to prayer, and patiently adhere to it; We ask of you no provision; it is We who provide for you. For the future outcome is for mindfulness (of God)."
  },
  "20:133": {
    "t": "And they said, “If only he were to bring us a sign from his Lord!” Were they not given evidence of whatever is in the former scrolls?"

  },
  "21:4": {
    "t": "He said, “My Lord knows what is said in the heaven and the earth, for He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.”"
  },
  "21:5": {
    "t": "But they said, “A jumble of dreams; rather, he fabricated it; rather, he is a poet, so let him bring us a sign like those sent to the ancients.”"
  },
  "21:6": {
    "t": "None of the towns We annihilated before them had believed. Will they, then, believe?"

    "t": "And never did We send before you but men to whom We reveal, so ask the people of the Reminder if you do not know."
  },
  "21:8": {
    "t": "And never did We make them a mere body, (ones) who eat no food, for never were they immortal."
  },
  "21:9": {
    "t": "Then We fulfilled the promise to them, so We saved them together with whomever We will, and We annihilated the extremists."
  },
  "21:10": {
    "t": "Most surely, We have sent down to you a Scripture containing your reminder. Do you not reason?"
  },
  "21:11": {
    "t": "And how many an unjust town have We crushed and established thereafter another people?"
  },
  "21:12": {
    "t": "Thus when they sensed Our force, they immediately ran away from it."
  },
  "21:13": {
    "t": "Do not run, but come back to the luxuries you were immersed in, and your residences, that you may be questioned."
  },
  "21:14": { "t": "They said, “Woe to us; indeed, we have been unjust.”" },
  "21:15": {
    "t": "Thus this continued to be their cry until We made them extinguished ashes."
  },
  "21:16": {
    "t": "And in no way did We create the sky and the earth and what is between them playfully."
  },
  "21:17": {
    "t": "If We wanted amusement, We could have obtained it from very close to Us, were We to do so."
  },
  "21:18": {
    "t": "Rather, We hurl the truth against falsehood so that it crushes it, and thus it vanishes. And woe unto you for what you describe."
  },
  "21:19": {
    "t": "For to Him belongs whomever is in the heavens and the earth. And those in His presence are not too arrogant to worship Him, nor do they grow weary."
  },
  "21:20": {
    "t": "They give due exaltation (to Him) night and day, never tiring."
  },

    "t": "Or have they taken to themselves gods from the earth who (can) resurrect?"
  },
  "21:22": {
    "t": "If there were in them gods other than Allah, they would have surely become corrupted. So Highly Exalted is Allah, Lord of the Throne, far above what they describe."
  },
  "21:23": {
    "t": "He is not asked about what He does, but they shall be asked."
  },
  "21:24": {
    "t": "Or have they taken apart from Him other gods? Say, “Bring your proof; this  is the reminder of those with me and the reminder of those before me.” Rather, most of them do not know the truth, so they disregard (it)."
  },
  "21:25": {
    "t": "And never did We send any messenger before you but We reveal to him that: “There is no god but I, so worship Me.”"
  },
  "21:26": {
    "t": "Yet they said, “The All-Merciful has taken to himself offspring.” Highly Exalted is He; rather, they are honored servants"
  },
  "21:27": {
    "t": "who never speak before Him, and they only act on His command."
  },
  "21:28": {
    "t": "He knows what is before them and what is behind them, and they do not intercede except for those whom He approves, and they tremble in awe of Him."
  },
  "21:29": {
    "t": "And whoever of them says, “I am a god apart from Him,” We will repay him with Hell; thus We repay the unjust."
  },
  "21:30": {
    "t": "Do the deniers not see that the heavens and the earth were one mass, and then We tore them apart? And We made from water every living thing; will they not believe?"

    "t": "And We put firm mountains on the earth, lest it sway with them; and We set broad pathways on it, that they might be guided."
  },
  "21:32": {
    "t": "And We made the sky a preserved ceiling, yet they disregard its signs."

  "21:33": {
    "t": "And it is He who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon, each floating in an orbit."
  },
  "21:34": {
    "t": "And never did We grant immortality to any human being before you. Should you die, are they then the immortal?"
  },
  "21:35": {
    "t": "Every single self is bound to taste death, for We test you with evil and good as a means of trial, and to Us you are returned."
  },
  "21:36": {
    "t": "And when those who have denied see you, they treat you only with ridicule: “Is this the one who mentions your gods?” For of the reminder of the All-Merciful they themselves are deniers."
  },
  "21:37": {
    "t": "Man was created of haste. I will show you My signs, so do not ask Me to hasten."
  },
  "21:38": {
    "t": "And they say, “When will this promise come true, if you are truthful?”"
  },
  "21:39": {
    "t": "If those who have denied only knew the time when they will not be able to keep the Fire off their faces nor off their backs, nor will they be supported!"
  },
  "21:40": {
    "t": "Rather, it will come upon them suddenly and bewilder them, so they will not be able to repel it, nor will they be given respite."
  },
  "21:41": {
    "t": "And most surely (other) messengers before you were ridiculed, but those who mocked were surrounded by what they used to ridicule."
  },
  "21:42": {
    "t": "Say, “Who guards you by night and day from the All-Merciful?” But they disregard the reminder of their Lord."
  },
  "21:43": {
    "t": "Or do they have gods that can defend them against Us? They cannot support themselves, nor will they find anyone to side with them against Us."
  },
  "21:44": {
    "t": "Rather, We gave these people and their forefathers enjoyments until time grew long upon them. Do they not see how We gradually reduce the land from its extremities? Are they then the overcomers?"
  },
  "21:45": {
    "t": "Say, “Indeed, I am only warning you through revelation.” But the deaf cannot hear the call when they are being warned."
  },
  "21:46": {
    "t": "And if a whiff of your Lord’s punishment touches them, they say, “Woe to us, We have truly been unjust.”"
  },
  "21:47": {
    "t": "And We set up the scales of justice for the Day of Resurrection so that not a single self suffers the least injustice, and even if it be the weight of a mustard seed, We bring it forth. For sufficient are We as reckoners."
  },
  "21:48": {
    "t": "And very truly, We gave Moses and Aaron the Criterion and illumination and a reminder for the ones who were mindful (of God):"
  },
  "21:49": {
    "t": "those who fear their Lord, though Unseen, and are apprehensive of the Hour."
  },
  "21:50": {
    "t": "And this (too) is a blessed Reminder that We have sent down. Are you going to reject it?"
  },
  "21:51": {
    "t": "And most surely, We brought Abraham his prudence before, and We well knew of him"
  },
  "21:52": {
    "t": "when he said to his father and his people, “What are these statues to which you are devoted?”"
  },
  "21:53": { "t": "They said, “We found our forefathers worshiping them.”" },
  "21:54": {
    "t": "He said, “You and your forefathers have been in evident misguidance.”"
  },
  "21:55": {
    "t": "They said, “Have you come to us with the truth, or are you one of the jesters?”"
  },

    "t": "And by Allah, I shall certainly plot against your human-shaped idols after you have turned away, fleeing.”"

  "21:58": {
    "t": "So he reduced them into pieces, except for their biggest, that they may return to it."
  },
  "21:59": {
    "t": "They said, “Who did this to our gods? Indeed, he is certainly one of the unjust.”"

    "t": "He said, “Rather, it was this biggest of them that did it, so ask them, if they can talk.”"
  },
  "21:64": {
    "t": "So they turned to one another and said, “Indeed, you yourselves are the unjust.”"

  "21:65": {
    "t": "But they reverted to their old ideas: “You certainly know well that these do not talk.”"
  },
  "21:66": {
    "t": "He said, “Do you worship, apart from Allah, what can neither benefit you in anything nor harm you?"

  "21:67": {
    "t": "Fie on you and on what you worship apart from Allah. Do you not reason?”"
  },
  "21:68": {
    "t": "They said, “Burn him and support your gods, if you are going to act.”"
  },
  "21:69": { "t": "We said, “O fire, be cool and peaceful upon Abraham.”" },
  "21:70": {
    "t": "For they wanted to plot against him, so We made them the biggest losers."
  },
  "21:71": {
    "t": "And We delivered him and Lot to the land that We blessed for all (people of all) realms."
  },
  "21:72": {
    "t": "And We granted him Isaac and Jacob as an additional gift, and each We made righteous."
  },
  "21:73": {
    "t": "And We made them leaders, guiding by Our command, and We revealed to them (the command of) performing good works and establishing the prayer and bringing the purifying charity, for of Us they were worshipers."
  },
  "21:74": {
    "t": "And Lot—We gave him wise judgment and knowledge, and We delivered him from the town that used to practice nasty things. They were indeed a wicked, defiantly disobedient people."
  },
  "21:75": {
    "t": "And We entered him into Our mercy; He is indeed one of the righteous."

  "21:76": {
    "t": "And Noah, when he called before, so We responded to him and delivered him and his family from the great calamity."

    "t": "And We supported him against the people who disbelieved Our Signs; indeed, they were a wicked people, so We drowned them all."
  },
  "21:78": {
    "t": "And David and Solomon, when they gave judgment in the case of the field, when some people’s sheep wandered therein by night. And to their judgment We were witnesses."
  },
  "21:79": {
    "t": "Yet We made Solomon understand it, and to each We gave wise judgment and knowledge. And We subjected the mountains to give (God) due exaltation along with David, and the birds as well—surely We did."
  },
  "21:80": {
    "t": "And We taught him the making of shields for you, so that they may secure you from your violence, so are you then appreciative?"

  "21:82": {
    "t": "And of the devils were some that would dive for him and perform other, lesser tasks, but We were preserving of them."

    "t": "And Job, when he called upon his Lord: “Great harm has touched me, yet You are the Most Merciful of the merciful.”"

  "21:84": {
    "t": "So We responded to him and lifted the harm which had afflicted him, and We brought him his family and their like with them—a mercy from Us, and a reminding for the worshipers."
  },
  "21:85": {
    "t": "And Ishmael and Enoch and Ezekiel; each is one of the steadfast."
